# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

- **Name of company:** Kinetisense
- **Incorporation Date:** Kinetisense was founded in 2013.
- **Founders:** Kinetisense was co-founded by Dr. Ryan Comeau and David Schnare.
- **Company's Origin:** As a chiropractor, Dr. Ryan Comeau recognized a demand for a sophisticated human motion analysis tool during his practice. He realized that existing tools were outdated, prompting him to develop a modern solution. The idea stemmed from his undergraduate studies, where he identified a demand for more advanced techniques in movement analysis.
- **Funding:** Details regarding the company's funding are undisclosed. The founder likely made the initial investment to get Kinetisense.

## Business Activities

- **Problem Addressed:** One of the major issues facing clinical treatments was the reliance on archaic tools and techniques, which enforced a treatment-driven clinical method. The Kinetisense iOS system offers a portable solution that allows practitioners to quickly gather data, which can be used for more accurate insurance claims. This capability has enabled Kinetisense to disrupt the treatment-driven paradigm in clinical methods, in favor of an assessment-driven approach. 

> As the world’s first patented markerless motion capture analysis system, Kinetisense allows you to engage with your patients and provide them real-time biofeedback for how they truly move.

This assessment-driven paradigm provides accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment, analysis of underlying root causes, insights into preventive care, and monitoring of improvement, all while saving money and time.
- **Intended Customers:** Kinetisense’s primary intended customers are older adults looking to minimize their risk of debilitating injuries and clinicians seeking to increase revenue per patient, enhance patient retention, and maximize profit. Their initial target audience has since then expanded to include athletes and coaches seeking ways to improve performance, veterans and their caregivers, employers seeing ergonomic solutions for their employees.
- **Unique Offering:** Kinetisense’s 3D mocap engine enhances accuracy by about 30% compared to their competitors. This removes disruptive outlier data, making Kinetisense the preferred clinical assessment tool.
- **Technologies Utilized:**
  - Motion Capture: Kinetisense uses motion capture technology, such as cameras, sensors, and wearable devices, to analyze human movement.
  - Computer Vision: Algorithms are used to process and analyze motion capture data, tracking the movement of specific body parts and identifying joints and markers, allowing for real-time biomechanical analysis.
  - Artificial Intelligence: Using AI, Kinetisense is able to achieve more accurate results from their data and gain insights into outlier data, recognizable patterns, and predictive analytics.
  - Mobile and Web Technologies: With their Kinetisense iOS system, Kinetisense is able to provide convenient and lightweight mobile solutions for their customers to use anywhere.
  - Cloud Computing: Using cloud computing, Kinetisense is able to process large amounts of information within the cloud and provide real-time access to assessment results to users while allowing them to collaborate with other professionals online.
  - Data Visualization: By presenting their data with intuitive graphs, charts, and 3D models, Kinetisense is able to convey complex information effectively and easy to interpret.

## Landscape

- **Field:** Kinetisense operates mostly within the healthcare industry.

- **Major Trends and Innovations:**
  - AI and Medical Imaging: Medical imaging technology has allowed algorithms to analyze MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans to detect abnormalities, improving diagnosis speed and accuracy.
  - Predictive Analytics and Early Disease Detection: AI-powered predictive models analyze large datasets for early disease detection and intervention.
  - Remote Patient Monitoring and Telemedicine: Wearable devices and telecommunications enable remote patient monitoring and telemedicine, facilitating communication between patients and doctors without in-person visits.
  - Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality: VR and AR offer additional ways for medical professionals to refine surgical technique and gain insights that cannot be reached without using 3D images.
  - Natural Language Processing: NLP streamlines medical documentation tasks by processing patient records and notes quickly and easily.
- **Major Companies:** Siemens Healthineers, Teladoc Health, and 23andMe are among the notable competitors actively innovating in the healthcare sector.

## Results

- **Business Impact:** Kinetisense’s major success has been in its unique way of gathering and analyzing healthcare information. By using objective data gained from visual analysis, clinicians gain new insights and new routes for treatments that other healthcare providers may not consider.
- **Core Metrics:** While Kinetisense's metrics differ from traditional healthcare standards, success is measured through total assessments completed and return on investment for their clients. Their success is their clients' success.
- **Competitive Performance:** Kinetisense has found a niche within the healthcare industry. Their services are competitive within the niche requirements their clients may have. That said, the niche scope in the healthcare industry that Kinetisense helps fill has somewhat prevented them from having prolific growth as a narrow category of clinicians would benefit from their service.

## Recommendations

- **Product/Service Suggestion:** I feel that Kinetisense has a lot of untapped potential to benefit the sports industry. While their technology is already helping athletes improve their form while performing simple exercises, by using their technology to analyze specialized movements within sports, such as figure skating, they can provide powerful coaching tools.
- **Benefits:** This expansion would offer athletes additional resources to help them improve their technique. In many sports like figure skating and gymnastics, some movements happen so quickly that the human eye cannot gain enough information to provide useful feedback. Kinetisense’s technology could fill the gap that some elite athletes cannot get from their coaches, providing micro-corrections to help them perfect their form. Additionally, this technology could be used to
